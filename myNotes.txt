short data type uses 2 bytes of storage
int: 4
long: 8, you have to add the suffix "L" at the end
float: 4, rounded to approximately 7 digits. Need to add "F"
double, precision 15 digits

double is default and is recommended, unless memory is a concern

char: used to store single Unicode characters like "@", "A", "p". 2 bytes of memory

converting data types is knows as type casting. If we want to convert a smaller type into a larger one we dont need to do anything specifically. It's called widening primitive conversion... the opposite is called narrowing conversion. Can result in loss of data.
